This repository consists of 5 small machine learning projects.

Concept Learning: Determine whether the risk of defaulting on a loan is "high" or "low" using the FIND-S algorithm and LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE algorithm
Decision Tree: Use decision tree to do two tasks: 1. predict whether a song was a "hit" meaning it made it onto the Billboard Top 50; 2. predict the final grad for high school students
Hidden Markov Models: Implement an HMM and its associated algorithm for the task of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, which is a central task in Natural Language Processing
Naive Bayes Classifier: Implement a Naive Bayes classifier to classify a political blog as being "liberal" or "conservative"
Neural Network: Implement a neural network with one hidden layer in MATLAB from scratch and do the same tasks as in the Decision Tree.
